# Agent Development Workflow

Our development process is managed through GitHub issues in the `<repo-owner/repo-name>` repository.

1.  **Feature Definition:** The Product Owner creates a detailed feature request as a GitHub issue.
2.  **Architectural Review:** The System Architect reviews the feature, proposes a technical implementation plan, and asks clarifying questions in the issue comments.
3.  **Product Owner Approval:** The Product Owner reviews the plan, answers any questions, and approves the plan through issue comments.
4.  **Implementation:** The System Architect proceeds with the implementation based on the approved plan.
5.  **Iterative Development:** This cycle repeats for new features, building incrementally on previous work.
