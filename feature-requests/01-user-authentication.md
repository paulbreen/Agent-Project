# Feature: User Authentication

**User Story:**

As a user, I want to be able to create an account and log in to the application so that I can save and access my articles.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   A user can sign up for a new account using an email and password.
*   A user can log in to their account using their email and password.
*   A user can log out of their account.
*   Passwords should be securely hashed and stored.
*   (Optional) A user can sign up/log in using their Google or GitHub account.

**Technical Notes:**

*   This feature will require a user management system and a database to store user information.
*   Consider using a library like Passport.js for authentication.
