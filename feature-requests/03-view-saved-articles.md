# Feature: View Saved Articles

**User Story:**

As a user, I want to be able to see a list of all my saved articles so that I can choose which one to read.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   A logged-in user can navigate to a page that displays a list of their saved articles.
*   Each item in the list should display the article's title, the original source (domain name), and an estimated reading time.
*   The list should be paginated if there are many articles.
*   Clicking on an article in the list should take the user to the article reader view.
